# Yelp Data Analysis Using AWS & Snowflake

## Project Description

In this end-to-end data analysis project, I processed over 7 million Yelp reviews and performed sentiment analysis and EDA using SQL, AWS S3, and Snowflake. This project showcases a full data pipeline — from data ingestion and storage to analysis and insights — offering a comprehensive walkthrough of building scalable analytics solutions using AWS and Snowflake.

## Project Workflow 
* Data Ingestion → JSON files (Yelp reviews & business data)
* Cloud Storage (AWS) → Amazon S3
* Data Warehousing → Snowflake (structured tables)
* Sentiment Analysis → SQL UDFs
* Business Insights → SQL queries

## Key Takeaways:
* Efficiently handled large datasets by splitting a massive JSON file into smaller, manageable chunks for better performance.
* Migrated data from AWS S3 to Snowflake using the COPY command with optimized file formats for faster ingestion.
* Implemented User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to perform sentiment analysis.
* Wrote and executed 10+ analytical SQL queries to uncover business insights, trends, and sentiment-driven patterns.
* Tackled and resolved performance bottlenecks in Snowflake to enable faster, large-scale data processing.
